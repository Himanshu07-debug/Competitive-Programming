PROBLEM-01 ----------------->> 

--> Must see Question, when numbers are formed with Some Given set of Numbers. 
    Numbers are formed with 1, 14, 144. Check the given number is VALID ?? Use substr() logic to test all possibilitis



PROBLEM-02 ----------------->> 

--> Equation -> a^2 + b = n .. Max value a can take?? Minimize b to the lowest to get the maximum value of all
    Technique -> Minimize one will maximize the Other Other number in Equation to keep the equation VALID


PROBLEM-04 ---------------->> 

--> Modular Question : If you want the value of X in last valid cycle, try reducing the n To get the max possible
                    value of x possible
    DONT -> First Cycle me rem nikal liye and then usko cycle length se + kar rhe jab tk last cycle pe nhi pahucte, this
    Approach can gice TLE, max chahiye, to RHS se chalu karo solving, naaki LHS se

    N mod x = y ==> In this 2 cases are possible : rem >= y OR rem < y , You have to handle both


PROBLEM-05 ---------------->> 

---> Jaise Peak element me corner wale elements ke liye loop ke upar hi check kar lete the, We can take 3 copy of arr,
        And middle wale me traverse krke answer nikal sakte hai
