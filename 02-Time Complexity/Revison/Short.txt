PROBLEM-01 ----------------->> 

--> Must see Question, when numbers are formed with Some Given set of Numbers. 
    Numbers are formed with 1, 14, 144. Check the given number is VALID ?? Use substr() logic to test all possibilitis


PROBLEM-02 ----------------->> 

--> Equation -> a^2 + b = n .. Max value a can take?? Minimize b to the lowest to get the maximum value of all
    Technique -> Minimize one will maximize the Other Other number in Equation to keep the equation VALID


PROBLEM-04 ---------------->> 

--> Modular Question : 
    If You have a equation K % X = Y .. And You have to find the maximum value of K [1 <= k <= N] ===>
    DONT -> Remainder y pta hai, usko add kar denge last cycle valid cycle tk
    Approach can gice TLE, max chahiye, to RHS se chalu karo solving, i.e last cycle ke baare me socho, naaki LHS se

    N mod x = y ==> In this 2 cases are possible : rem >= y OR rem < y , You have to handle both


PROBLEM-05 ---------------->> 

---> Jaise Peak element me corner wale elements ke liye loop ke upar hi check kar lete the, We can take 3 copy of arr,
        And middle wale me traverse krke answer nikal sakte hai


PROBLEM 06 & 09 --------------->> 

Some questions are Pure Mathemathical, Some examples are here.. Either the logic is very NAIVE or you have to Derive

Q.s -> You have reduce n to 1. You can either multiply n by 2 or divide by 6 in each operation.. How ?? 
HINT -> Is it beneficial to multiply against divide. Aur divide bhi kab answer denga

Q.s -> n can be formed by 3 fib. no.s [n is also fibonccai] ? 

Q.S -> Find two Composite integers such that a - b = n .. n is given ???


PROBLEM-10 ----------------->> 

---> MATRIX Observation ( MUST SEE )

PROBLEM-11 ----------------->> 

--> To get kth sum of Odd numbers -> k*k      ( 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + ... )
    To get kth sum of Odd numbers -> k*(k+1)  ( 2 + 6 + 12 + 20 + ... )
    NOTE : A.P ke sum wale formulae se nikale


PROBLEM-12 ------------------->> 

--> In multiset, To directly get the value -> int x = *mst.begin();

Q.s -> Apko 3 integers diye hai, can you make them equal in atmost 3 operations (kisi bhi integer ko cut kr skte ho unequal yaa equal parts me)

HINT -> Kya aap teeno integer pe kar sakte ho kya operation, And if Yes, then WHEN ???
