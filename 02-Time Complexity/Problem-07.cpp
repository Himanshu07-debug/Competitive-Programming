// Equation 

// Composite numbers are NON-PRIME no.s

// Constraints are TIGHT to find a and b , try to reduce the equation a - b = n

// LOGIC : Any no. multiplied with a Composite number is a Composite Number

// REDUCING THE EQUATION -> 9*n - 8*n = n  [ 9*n, 8*n are Composite Numbers becz 9,8 are both composite number ]

// Other numbers are alos Possible
