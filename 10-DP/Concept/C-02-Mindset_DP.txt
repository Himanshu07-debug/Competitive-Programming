### HOW TO SOLVE A DP PROBLEM ?????

1. Think about the Subproblem ( STATE ) .
   Most IMP is to Figure out the Parameter( KEY ) that is Going to uniquely Determine our SubProblems ( STATE )


2. Think About Breaking it into Smaller SubProblems ...

3. Think about the relation between Smaller Subproblems to compute bigger Subproblem ( TRANSITION )..
   In Fibonacci, the Relation was Given, but You have to Figure out this Relation in other PROBLEM..


4. Where Does the above Relation( 3rd point ) will not work ( BASE CASE ) or Smallest Subproblem That I can solve

5. What is the Biggest PROBLEM to solve ( Final SubProblem ) 



#### TIP FOR DP ---> Identify Overlapping SubProblem from Recursion Tree


#### TIME COMPLEXITY ------------------->>

1. If all States have same time   --> no. of States * avg transition time per State  .. ( O(n)  --> O(n) --> O(n) --> .... )

2. If all States have varying time ---> Sum of transition time for each state i from 1 to n .. (O(n) --> O(n/2) --> O(n/3) --> .....)


### SPACE COMPLEXITY ------------------->>

No. of states * Space Complexity of each state



### WHERE TO APPLY DP ???

1. No. of ways
2. Min/Max answer
3. Checking for Possibility
