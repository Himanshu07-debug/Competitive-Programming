// There are N cities numbered 1 to N. In each city i, the leader VSM has infinite statues. Jenish chooses two cities L and R each day and
//  destroys statues in the range [L, R]. He destroys i-L+1 statues in the ith city (L ≤ i ≤ R). Find the total number of statues destroyed 
// in each city after Q days.

// Constraint --->  1 <= N,Q <= 10^6
