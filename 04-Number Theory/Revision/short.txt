PROBLEM - 01 ---------->>

A Good Modulo Question To see. Remember -> 2 is the only prime Number i.e even


PROBLEM - 02 ---------->>

If all divisors of N are given in a SORTED order, then we can get n by multiplying arr[0]*arr[n-1] , arr[1]*arr[n-2] .. Same like palindrome
CONCEPT --> DIVISORS OF ANY NUMBER ALWAYS COMES IN PAIR


PROBLEM - 03 ---------->> 

IMP technique in the Question [ MUST SEE ] 
.. Agar Humko koi digit maximum baar produce krna hai apne Number me ??
-> For example 2478  -> max 9 produce krna hai ===> 2469 , 2399, 1999  .... KAISE KRONGE ???


PROBLEM - 05 ----------->> 

How to predict the numbers with atleast 4 divisors ? 
If A number have atleast 2 distinct divisors p,q , then pq is the number with divisors 1, p, q, pq
If divisors not distinct i.e a = p^k , then p^3 is the number with divisors 1, p, p^2, p^3


PROBLEM - 06 ----------->> 

MUST SEE ---> Observing the edge case and reducing the equation for answer
==> x + y = z  -> Condition => One should be exactly divisible by a*b only and two should be divisible by a only.. Find x,y,z ?


PROBLEM - 08 ----------->> 

=> N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 ...
=> Total No. of divisors for N = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) ....

Question -> Can we find an Integer A that have X divisors out of which K are Prime Factors ?? Return YES / No -
HINT -> X is the total number of Divisors. X me terms == No. of Prime Factors in a No. . Can I use this Logic -->

NOTE -> If not getting, see Answer logic .. Nicely Explained in Problem




PROBLEM - 09 -------------->> 

Try to not think TDS for the question, First see can you do it in a NAIVE way
Question -> Determine is it possible to remove some of the digits(possibly not remove any digit at all) so that the result contains 
            atleast one digit, no leading zeroes and is divisible by 8
LOGIC -> Here question ne nhi bola hai min/max removal, isliye Try out all the possible digits number divisible by sum.. HOW ??? 

TIP --> This is mostly when string is given in Input




PROBLEM - 10 --------------->>

A variation of Trapping RainWater Problem ...
Qs. => Change a[i] to min(a[l],a[r]) for l < i < r , Return max possible sum of array


PROBLEM - 11 --------------->>

In array Rotation Type of Problem, Agar n se rotate kiye to firse Same Array mil jaega .. Try to think in this way..

NOTE --> Modulo also helps in Rotation type of Problem becz array moves cyclic
EXAMPLE --> Top element of the array after x Rotation ==> arr[ x % n ]


PROBLEM - 20 ---------------->>

Q.s -> find out whether the number n can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 2020 and a certain number of numbers 2021.
HINT --> Koi Pattern to lag nhi rha no. me , kyu
Remember, Aaise Question equation me reduce hote hai --> N =  2020*x + 2021*y , where x >=0 and y >= 0




12 - CONCEPT ------------->> 

Given (x | y) * ( x ^ y ) = N and N is an Odd number, Find x & y ?? 
===> When N is odd, Last bit is set and therefore :: N ^ (N - 1) ==> 1 , becz N - 1 will make change only at the last bit, resulting XOR in 1
===> Similarly , OR will give N
