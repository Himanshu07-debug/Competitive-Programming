PROBLEM - 01 ---------->>

A Good Modulo Question To see. Remember -> 2 is the only prime no. i.e even


PROBLEM - 02 ---------->>

If all divisors of N are given in a SORTED order, then we can get n by multiplying arr[0]*arr[n-1] , arr[1]*arr[n-2] .. Same like palindrome
** CONCEPT --> DIVISORS OF ANY NUMBER ALWAYS COMES IN PAIR


PROBLEM - 03 ---------->> 

IMP technique in the Question [ MUST SEE ]


PROBLEM - 05 ----------->> 

How to predict the numbers with atleast 4 divisors ? 
If A number have atleast 2 distinct divisors p,q , then pq is the number with divisors 1, p, q, pq
If divisors not distinct i.e a = p^k , then p^3 is the number with divisors 1, p, p^2, p^3


PROBLEM - 06 ----------->> 

MUST SEE ---> Observing the edge case and reducing the equation for answer


PROBLEM - 08 ----------->> 

Number ke K prime factors honge, this can be determine by Checking that Total Number of divisors can be reduced to K values greater than 1.
This K values can be even or Odd

** No. = p1^a1 * p2^a2 ...
** Total No. of divisors = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) ....


PROBLEM - 09 -------------->> 

Try to avoid doing TDS thing, Do only that much which is actually required.. In CP, First try for NAIVE in constraints


10 - CONCEPT ------------->> 

Given (x | y) * ( x ^ y ) = N and N is an Odd number, Find x & y ?? 
===> When N is odd, Last bit is set and therefore :: N ^ (N - 1) ==> 1 , becz N - 1 will make change only at the last bit, resulting XOR in 1
===> Similarly , OR will give N
