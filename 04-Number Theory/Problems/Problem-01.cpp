// P % a = P % b
// 2 ≤ a < b ≤ P    P --> Prime

// Constraint : 5 ≤ P ≤ 10^9  ,  2 ≤ a < b ≤ P

// LOGIC : Simple question becz constraint are helping , a can be 2 , and we remainder of 2 with any number is 0 or 1, so we will take a = 2

// P is Prime , so it will take only odd values, becz 2 is the only prime no. that is even
