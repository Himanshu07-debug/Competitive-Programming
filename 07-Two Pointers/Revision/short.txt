PROBLEM - 01 ------------------->>

Permutation of required Characters is same as ANAGRAM CHECKING

Q.s -> Count of occurencess of anagram of string txt on the String s.

HINT ->> Sliding window + cnt[256]

Follow-up -> Is String s contain Permutation of string txt as a Substring in it or not ???


PROBLEM - 02 ------------------>>

Q.s -> 2 sorted arrays given. The number of pairs (i,j) for which a[i] == b[j] ???

HINT --> How many Condition to check ?? The code approach will be Similar to ???



PROBLEM - 03 ------------------>>

Q.s -> No. of Segments with difference between max and min element is atmost k..

HINT -> Which Type of Good Segment technique Problem ? What Container You will used ??



PROBLEM - 04 ------------------->>

Q.s -> A segment is good if its sum <= k. Find the Sum of the lengths of all possible Good Segments.

HINT -> Which Type of Technique Problem ? How to calculate the SUM OF LENGTHS OF POSSIBLE GOOD SEGMENTS for our answer ? LOGIC ???

HINT 2 -> [1,2,3] me 3 se end hone wale 3 subarray possible... Yeah 3 Subarray ke length ka Sum ek pattern follow krta hai , See...



PROBLEM - 05 ------------------->>

Q.s -> Girl likes 2 boys. Inorder to keep the relationship going on the, Girl has to keep the boys more than k distance far from each other. 
       How many ways girl can choose the 2 valid Places for 2 boys ? [ arr is sorted ]
       Ex -> Available Places arr = [1 3 5 8] , k = 4  ==> 2  ( (1,8) & (3,8) only possible ) 

HINT - 1 ==> O(nlogn) approach .. Binary Search ?? 
HINT - 2 ==> upperBound can be used ...

HINT - 3 ==> O(n) solution --> Two Pointers ???

HINT - 4 ==> Observe, This Question can be deduce as => Number of Subarrays with arr[j] - arr[i] > k .. arr[j] > arr[i] + k . Technique ??



CONCEPT --------------------->>

Agar Apko set of numbers diye hai and ->
If You have to make all the elements equal in min. number of Operation and In one Operation, it is allowed to increase or Decrease the elements 
value by any number x , Making all the elements equal to the Middle element or Median is the Optimal Option

-> Each window of size k ke elements equal banao.. So Median ke equal kr dena
