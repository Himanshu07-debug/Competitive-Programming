PROBLEM - 02 ------------------->>

String made up of A and B. Smallest String that we can make by removing AB/BB ...
HINT -> Is there any common thing in the removal that you can take for removal



PROBLEM - 03 ---------------------------->>

0001101010 .. Can you make it SORTED by removing a subset of character only once. You cant take adjacent indexes in Subset selection..

TIP -> Jab Question YES/NO ka aaye, then Aaise Question me You have to think for the case where You can't select the Subset



PROBLEM - 04 -------------->>

A string can be make Palindrome only if ->
Length even -> All character cnt should be even 
Length odd -> Only one character with odd cnt is allowed



PROBLEM - 05 -------------------->>

CONCEPT -> A number is divisble by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8 

Question -> Can You make the given number is Divisble by 8 ??
HINT -> Agar Divisor less than 10 hai to unit place digit ko leave krke usase phle saare number aa sakte hai 1 to infinity .. becz increment to the 
        the next value in table is less than 10. 
        EX -> 8 KE LIYE ==> 000, 008, 016, 024, 032, ..... , 096, 104 ..... So on 

TASK -> We have to only ensure that ki uss number ke sath wla unit digit 0-9 me se usme lagado..



PROBLEM - 07 --------------------->>>

LPS ka Question DSA wla .. Here done with String Hashing..
-> There are 2 Approaches --->>
==> 1 -> Front se hash alag way me nikalo and Back se alag way me ... Figure out this way so that hash Front and back ki same rahe at i and n-i-1
==> 2 -> V.V.IMP --> String Hashing with Answering Range Queries ..



CONCEPT --> Agar Single Hashing se Bahut Test cases pass ho gye, lekin Kuch testcase with Bigger String length Wrong Asnwer de rhe, Yeah Collision se 
            hai ,, USE DOUBLE - Hashing




PROBLEM - 08 --------------------->>>
Q.s --> Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
HINT --> Variable length Sliding Window




PROBLEM - 10 --------------------->>>

Q.s -> Find the no. of possible substrings with "bear" as a substring ??

TASK 1 --> 1 <= s.size() <= 5000 i.e 5 * 10^3
HINT --> We can check out all the Substring .. Constraint is not TIGHT ... Code kaise kronge (V.V.IMP) ?? PSEUDO ??

TASK 2 --> 1 <= s.size() <= 5 * 10^5
HINT --> RABIN KARP occ. ki list de denga.. Occ ke index se how to guess kitne substring me "bear" rhnga ????
HINT 2 --> No. of Starting Point possible and No. of Ending Pt. possible se kuch kar sakte hai kya ???



PROBLEM - 11 -------------------->>

MAP / SET me string me string insert krte ho to TIME ==> O(s.size() * log(container size)) , container size -> No. of distinct strings inserted
WHY THIS HAPPEN ?? After insertion, To store in SORTED WAY, Comparison happen

NOTE -> Agar inserted string worst case me n length ki possible hai to TIME --> O( n * log(k) ) ==> O(nlogn) ...
        So in such case , insert HASH value of String

Q.s -> No. of distinct Substrings , String size can be of 1500 characters max .. 1 <= n <= 1.5 * 10^3
HINT -> Hum Brute way me No. of Substrings nikal sakte hai but substring SET me insert krnge which can be n size ==> O(n * nlog(n)) -> TLE
        
NOTE --> Insert HASH value in SET .. See Code How to do so by Double Hashing ???



PROBLEM - 12 --------------------->>

Q.s -> Find the longest Substring which is prefix, suffix and in middle of prefix, suffix .. All separately .. 1 <= n <= 10^5
==> lps se Prefix suffix pta chal jayega, beech ka kya.. You cant traverse becz it will O(n^2) .. 
HINT --> Store the indexes of Valid lps in an array. Ab Binary search lagado array me for finding longest length.. Predicate me Rabin Karp for 
        checking that the occ. is >= 3 or not ..
