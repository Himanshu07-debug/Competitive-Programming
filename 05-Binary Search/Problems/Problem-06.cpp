// You are given an integer array a1,a2,â€¦,an and integer k. In one step you can either 
// 1. choose some index i and decrease a[i] by one (make a[i] = a[i] âˆ’ 1 );
// or 2. choose two indices i and j and set a[i] equal to a[j] --> make a[i] = a[j]

// What is the minimum number of steps you need to make the sum of array i.e sum(a) <= k
