NOTE --> 

Must see the C-02 --> Binary Search Tip notes.. then come here ....

PROBLEM - 01 -------------------------->> 

In Interactive Problem... Binary Search is always used ...
TIP -> Whenever You have a MONOTONIC Range of Number where Your Answer can lie, You can find the max/min VALID pt. by BINARY Search

EXAMPLE -> All vertices have integer coordinates within [-1000, 1000] and non-negative y-coordinates. [-1000, 1000] is our Search Space

NOTE -> MUST SEE QUESTION.. How we decode all required lengths by using BINARY Search ..


PROBLEM - 02 ------------------------->>

In Binary Search Logic, we can use MAP, SET, LOWER-BOUND, UPPER-BOUND as they all are built on sorted data having O(logn) complexity
Example -> BS code se element search krne se aacha SET ka find() se krlo

Q.s -> Find the Number of pairs in array such that arr[i] - arr[j] == k ... (i < j or j < i)

HINT1 --> (i < j or j < i) --> This mean array elements ka koi bhi arrangement kar sakte ho.. Answer affect nhi honga.. I mean Sorting...
HINT2 --> LowerBound can be used.. But yha inefficent rhnga kyu ???
HINT3 --> Becz arr[i] + k ke equal nhi hua element to... Set can also be not efficient , why ??? ( k == 0 )
HINT4 --> MAP is best to use


PROBLEM - 03 ------------------------>>

Q.s -> Given an Array of Worloads, split it among K workers, Such that the maximum work that any Worker has to do is minimized..
        Eg -> K = 3 , A = [10,5,20,50,25,45,15]  ===> 75
        Possible allocation of work -> 
        [10,5,20] [50,25] [45,15] -> max(35, 75, 60) => 75
        [10,5] [20,50,25] [45,15] -> max(15, 95, 60) => 95

HINT --> Aapke pass K buckets hai, unko allocate krna hai elements in such that the maximum sum of a bucket is min. , kaise kronge ?
HINT2 --> Typical DSA BOOK ALLOCATION Problem .. Immediate click hona chahiye ...


PROBLEM - 04 ------------------------>>

Q.s -> A factory has n machines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to make a total of t products.
        For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single product. The machines can work simultaneously ..
        What is the shortest time needed to make t products?
        Eg -> n = 3, t = 7,  [3,2,5]   ==> 8  ( 8 sec me 3 sec wla 2, 2 sec wla 4, 5 sec wla 1 products ===> Total 7 Products )

HINT 1 -> BS ? Search Space kispe ? Movement kaisa ? Search Space ka Graph kaise banega ??
HINT 2 -> simultaneously Working allowed hai, Predicate function ??
HINT 3 -> Same like P parathas Problem


PROBLEM - 05 ----------------------->>

Q.s ->  There are n ropes, you need to cut k pieces of the same length from them. Find the maximum length of pieces you can get.
        Eg -> n = 4 , k = 11 , [ 802, 743, 457, 539 ] , Constraint --> 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10000  ,  1 <= arr[i] <= 10^7
        Answer -> 200.5
        NOTE --> The answer will be considered correct if the relative or absolute error does not exceed 10^−6

HINT 1 -> What Does the NOTE line mean ?? Yha pe Precision me answer chahiye .. How to do apply BS when answers in Double Datatype are accepted ?
HINT 2 -> In this Question, Apne Search Space ki length kitni ho gyi hai ?? r value in our answer Search Space ???
HINT 3 -> Each integer have a precision of 1e-6 i.e there are 1e6 decimal places for each integer. Now Total Search Space ??
HINT 4 -> Min. no. of times our BS should iterate to get the Answer ???? log2(1e8 * 1e6 ) ...
HINT 5 -> log(1e18) -> 63 .  So you will iterate for 100 times to get Highly precised value .. setprecision() on kar dena with fixed..
HINT 6 -> l = m + 1 , r  = m - 1 kyu nhi ... 


PROBLEM - 06 ---------------------------->>

Q.s -> At some points on the road there are n friends, and i-th of them is standing at the point x[i] meters and can move with any speed no 
       greater than v[i] meters per second in any of the two directions along the road: south or north.
        You are to compute the minimum time needed to gather all the n friends at some point on the road.  
        Note that the point they meet at doesn't need to have integer coordinate. 

        Eg -> n = 3, x = [7,1,3] , v = [1,2,1] ==> 2 sec

HINT1 --> The Main Thing in any BS Question i.e Predicate Function , iska kaise likhonge ???
HINT2 --> Har ek person ki ek range rhngi kisi bhi time t pe movement ki, can You guess?
HINT3 --> [xi - t*vi, xi + t*vi] -> ith frnd ... How you will find the Intersection pt. in all these ranges...


PROBLEM O8 is not mine Piece of Cake

PROBLEM - 08 ------------------------------>>

Q.s -> Matrix di hai m * n ki. m shops hai and n frnd no. denote kar rha hai. arr[i][j] -> Gift from ith shop is allocated to jth frnd.. 
       ith shop ka Gift jth frnd ko arr[i][j] value ka joy deta hai. You have to find X value as high as Possible. X = min(a1, a2, .. , an)..
       a[i] -> joy allocated to ith frnds. Saare n frnds ko gift allcoate honi chahiye and you can visit only n-1 shops.

OBSERVE -> X min hai allocation ka and Uski high value manga hai -> We have to maximize the minimum joy allocated to a frnd 

HINT 1 -> Search Space ? n frnd ke liye n-1 shops, this means ?
HINT 2 -> there should be a shop jha se aap atleast 2 frnd ke liye gift le sako...
HINT 3 -> Do not Worry about Max/Min. Wo BS dekh lenga. Aap Correct Predicate kaise likhonge ???
HINT 4 -> 2 things to check -> 1. ith frnd ko konse shop mid joy de sakte hai... --> vector<vector<int>> ans(n)
                               2. Kya koi ek shop hai jo 2 frnd ko >= mid joy de sakta hai --> visited[m]


PROBLEM - 09 --------------------------------->>

Q.s -> You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it: Choose one of the elements of the 
        array (for example ai ) and increase it by 1 (that is, replace it with ai+1 ). 
        You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.

HINT 1 -> For a number to be median, n/2 elements smaller and n/2 bigger rhnne chahiye.. Kyuki Yha pe n -> odd hai
HINT 2 -> Predicate Function ??  
HINT 3 -> Sort the array. Start from n/2 indx. if(arr[i] < m) -> cnt += (m - arr[i]); else cnt += 0



PROBLEM - 10 --------------------------------->>

What's the minimum number of days needed for a ship, starting at (x1, y1), to reach coordinates (x2, y2) based on a 
periodic wind forecast (U, D, L, R) of length n? The ship moves one unit up, down, left, or right according to the wind, and can stays 
in its place only. The wind direction repeats every n days.
The ship can also make its move alongwith wind moves when it aims to move i.e In order to move Diagonally, when Wind is blowing L, it goes
U, the ship will move ( x-1, y+1 ) .. If ship move U and wind is also moving U at that time, then it doubles (x, y + 2)

x1 = 0, y1 = 0
x2 = 4, y2 = 6
n = 3
str = "UUU"
OUTPUT -> 5 ( (0,0) → (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) → (4,4) → (4,6) )


NOTE -> Read the Question properly, what You understand ??

OBSERVE How we conclude to Go with BS ??
1. Greedy ho skta hai, But aapke paas Proof nhi hai Wo hamesha sahi denga... Constraint ke wajah se DP laga nhi sakte hai...
2. Q.s me min. bola hai and Greedy, DP nhi lag rha hai , Tab BS se hi min/max possible hai and Constraint bhi 10^5 hai ..
3. Sirf Yeah socho kya aap koi bhi x days me kitne moves lagenge, Nikal Sakte ho kya O(n) me , YES, Then Predicate ??
4. Agar Predicate me Logic and usko O(n) me implement kar diya, Aakhe band kro and use BS on the Search Space on Days...


HINT FOR PREDICATE --> Wind ke contirbution se kis cell tk pahuch sakte ho, And uss cell se muje kitne moves krne padenge , calculate, 
                       Agar merse kiya hu move <= x (current no. of days) , VALID ...
