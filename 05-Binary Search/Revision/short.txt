PROBLEM - 01 -------------------------->> 

In Interactive Problem... Binary Search is always used ...
TIP -> Whenever You have a MONOTONIC Range of Number where Your Answer can lie, You can find the max/min VALID pt. by BINARY Search

EXAMPLE -> All vertices have integer coordinates within [-1000, 1000] and non-negative y-coordinates. [-1000, 1000] is our Search Space

NOTE -> MUST SEE QUESTION.. How we decode all required lengths by using BINARY Search ..


PROBLEM - 02 ------------------------->>

In Binary Search Logic, we can use MAP, SET, LOWER-BOUND, UPPER-BOUND as they all are built on sorted data having O(logn) complexity
Example -> BS code se element search krne se aacha SET ka find() se krlo

Q.s -> Find the Number of pairs in array such that arr[i] - arr[j] == k ... (i < j or j < i)
HINT ==> (i < j or j < i) aaisa diya rhe to no need to worry arr[i] > arr[j] .. jo bada rha wo i ho jayega,
        only search arr[i] ke liye (arr[i] + k) present hai kya array ... For Searching, use MAP or SET .. 
        But SET nhi kar sakte use, WHY ???
