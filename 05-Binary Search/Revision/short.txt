PROBLEM - 01 -------------------------->> 

In Interactive Problem... Binary Search is always used ...
TIP -> Whenever You have a MONOTONIC Range of Number where Your Answer can lie, You can find the max/min VALID pt. by BINARY Search

EXAMPLE -> All vertices have integer coordinates within [-1000, 1000] and non-negative y-coordinates. [-1000, 1000] is our Search Space

NOTE -> MUST SEE QUESTION.. How we decode all required lengths by using BINARY Search ..


PROBLEM - 02 ------------------------->>

In Binary Search Logic, we can use MAP, SET, LOWER-BOUND, UPPER-BOUND as they all are built on sorted data having O(logn) complexity

Example -> BS code se element search krne se aacha SET ka find() se krlo
